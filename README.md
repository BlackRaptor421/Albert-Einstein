# Albert-Einstein
Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was one of the most influential scientists in history, best known for transforming our understanding of space, time, and energy. Born in Ulm, Germany, he showed curiosity and independent thinking from an early age, though he initially struggled in traditional schooling. After studying physics and mathematics in Switzerland, he worked at the Swiss Patent Office, where he continued developing groundbreaking ideas.

In 1905, often called his “Annus Mirabilis” (miracle year), Einstein published four revolutionary papers. Among them was the special theory of relativity, which introduced the famous equation **E = mc²**, revealing the relationship between mass and energy. This changed physics forever, laying the foundation for nuclear energy and modern cosmology.

In 1915, Einstein presented his **general theory of relativity**, which described gravity not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. This theory was confirmed in 1919 when astronomers observed starlight bending around the Sun during a solar eclipse. The discovery made Einstein an international celebrity.

He received the **Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921**, not for relativity, but for explaining the **photoelectric effect**, which demonstrated that light can behave as particles (photons). This work was essential to the development of quantum mechanics, though Einstein remained skeptical of some of its interpretations.

Einstein emigrated to the United States in 1933, fleeing Nazi Germany. He became a professor at Princeton University, where he worked until his death. While he opposed war, he warned of Nazi Germany’s nuclear ambitions, which indirectly influenced the Manhattan Project. After World War II, he became a strong advocate for peace, disarmament, and global cooperation.

Beyond science, Einstein was admired for his humanism, sharp wit, and deep concern for humanity. His legacy lives on not only in physics but also in culture, where his name remains a symbol of genius. /
